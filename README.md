This data analysis project focuses on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart's left ventricular muscle, which can impair its ability to efficiently pump oxygen-rich blood into the body. Expect an in-depth exploration of patterns and correlations related to age, gender, chest pain types, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and maximum heart rates among LVH patients. Using Tableau for exploratory data analysis, this project uncovers key insights such as the prevalence of heart disease by age group, cholesterol variations by gender, and relationships between age, blood pressure, and heart rate. The analysis leverages a clean and structured dataset to provide actionable insights into the risks and demographic factors associated with LVH.
